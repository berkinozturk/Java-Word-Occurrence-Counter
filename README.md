# Java-Word-Occurrence-Counter
The purpose of the provided Java code is to develop a program that counts the occurrences of the word "Java" in multiple text files concurrently. The program utilizes multithreading to achieve parallel processing, enhancing efficiency when dealing with multiple files. Each file is associated with a separate thread, allowing for simultaneous file reading and word counting. By implementing this approach, the code demonstrates how to leverage the power of threads to perform tasks in parallel, thereby optimizing the time taken for processing multiple files. This example serves as a practical demonstration of multithreading concepts and showcases how to handle file I/O operations within a multi-threaded environment, which can be useful in scenarios where processing efficiency is crucial, such as when working with large datasets or performing computationally intensive tasks.
